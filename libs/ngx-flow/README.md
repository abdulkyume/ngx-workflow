# ngx-flow

`ngx-flow` is a powerful and flexible open-source diagramming library for Angular 20+, inspired by React Flow. It enables you to create interactive flowcharts, node-based editors, and other diagramming tools with ease, leveraging SVG for rendering, Angular Signals for state management, and a clean TypeScript architecture.

## Features

-   **SVG Rendering:** High-performance, scalable vector graphics for crisp diagrams.
-   **Angular Signals:** Modern state management for reactive and efficient updates.
-   **Custom Nodes & Edges:** Easily extendable architecture to define your own node and edge components.
-   **Pluggable Layouts:** Integrate with popular graph layout algorithms like Dagre and ELK.
-   **Interactive Elements:** Dragging nodes, panning and zooming the canvas, connectable handles for creating edges.
-   **Lasso Selection:** Select multiple nodes with a drag-and-drop rectangle.
-   **Undo/Redo:** Built-in history management for operations.
-   **TypeScript:** Fully typed and designed for Angular best practices.
-   **OnPush Strategy:** Optimized change detection for performance.
